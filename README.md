# Core-Java
Core java basics with some DSA solutions (Basic to Advanced)
Solutions might not work for some test cases as in some solutions, I have not implemented the code for edge cases. 
If you like, you can add them by yourself, if possible, add edge cases for other questions as well.
This repo covers major aspect of core java, but some topics are remaining which will be covered soon.

Sarthak is a bitch.
